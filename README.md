Smart Flush üöΩ
Smart Flush is an automated, water-efficient sanitation system designed for public restrooms with Western-style toilets. Created as part of Smart India Hackathon 2024 (Problem Statement ID: SIH1546), it provides an innovative solution to optimize water usage, boost hygiene, and ensure sustainability through advanced technology and automation.

Features üåü
1) Automatic Presence Detection: Triggers functions like flushing and cleaning without manual input.

2). Waste Type Detection: Adjusts water use based on the type of waste for maximum efficiency.

3). Automatic Cleaning Jets: Ensures superior hygiene by cleaning the toilet after each use.

4). Automated Lid Operation: Provides a hands-free, seamless user experience.

5).Solar Power System: Fully powered by solar energy, reducing reliance on traditional electricity.

   
Sensors and Components Used üõ†Ô∏è

The Smart Flush system is powered by the following sensors and components:

1). MPR121 (Touch Sensor): Detects user presence and touch-based interactions.

2). HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Sensor): Measures distance to identify waste type for efficient flushing.

3). Motion Sensor: Detects movement to trigger lid and cleaning operations.

4). 5V DC Solenoid Valve: Controls water flow during flushing.

5). Arduino Microcontroller: Serves as the system's brain, integrating and controlling all components.

6). Servo Motor: Operates the toilet lid and cleaning jets for automation.
